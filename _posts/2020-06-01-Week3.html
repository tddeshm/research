    This week I attempted to model photoacoustics from a different perspective. For the past two weeks, I had been focusing on heat induced thermoelastic vibrations that resulted as a consequence of the laser directly heating the silicon diaphragm of the microphone. However, an alternative photoacoustic model is the thermal piston model which has been successfully utilized in [1]. In this model, pulsed laser light is absorbed by gas (ex. Ambient air) causing period expansion and contraction which then produces acoustic waves.

<h3 class="section-subheading">Pulsed Laser</h3>

<p>
    The first step in modeling was setting up a laser passing through a “box” of air (representing free air around the MEMs microphone). As a rough approximation, a laser fired with 60mW would retain that intensity until reaching the “box” of air (i.e. the only absorption of laser light would occur within the “box” of air). The reasoning behind this was based on the setup and results of [1]. An additional modification of the laser involved switching from a square wave approximation to a sine wave approximation due to the need for smoothing the incoming laser intensity. The laser was kept at the same frequency as in the previous model (200Hz).

    The relative intensities seen above indicate that the model is not absorbing light as intended. While we expect some absorption, the laser should still hit the microphone considering that the dimensions of the “box” of air is only 2cm x 2 cm which is smaller than the absorption path of light if we were accurately representing ambient air. Quantities to adjust include moisture content of air, the absorptivity parameter, and air density.

<h3 class="section-subheading">Acoustic Pressure</h3>

<p>
    After setting up the laser, heat transfer from laser to the surrounding air was added, and then the heat from the air was used as the source for changing pressure acoustics. Unfortunately, for the physics modules present, Comsol did not support direct coupling between heat and pressure acoustics making it more challenging to set up studies to look at both processes at the same time. 
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, we were not able to look at acoustic-solid interaction (acoustic interaction with the diaphragm) with time dependency. However, even looking at an eigenfrequency analysis of silicon movement assuming uniform heating of the air (no pulsed laser), there was no stress observed on the microphone due to acoustic pressure. If the thermal piston model was the source of vibrations in the solid, we would expect to see some level of stress on the diaphragm. 
</p>

<p>
    The next steps in checking the accuracy of the acoustic-solid interaction include sending an acoustic wave (known frequency) through the box and ensuring that there is some vibration of the solid. This will help us narrow down whether the coupling of solid structure and pressure acoustics is being registered by the model. Additionally, we can increase the laser pulse frequency up to 20KHz as seen in [1] to measure whether more frequent heating of the air results in changing eigenfrequencies of acoustic waves.

    Weekly Article: Ghost Talk
</h2>

<p>
    From this week forward, I will be including a section of the blog dedicated to learning more about cyber-physical systems security by reviewing important papers in the field. The paper I read this week was Ghost Talk [2], which explored intentional low-power EMI attacks on devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators, and microphones. I found this paper especially impactful because the biomedical aspect of the research has many consequences on the design and safety of cardiac implantable electronic devices. 
</p>

<p>
    Something that I struggled with while reading the paper was understanding the background behind the different types of attacks. Specifically, I did not understand the impact of nonlinear components of demodulators, and I wish that its importance had been emphasized more in the paper. Part of this comes from a lack of signal processing background, so I was glad that reading the paper gave me an opportunity to learn more signal processing concepts.
