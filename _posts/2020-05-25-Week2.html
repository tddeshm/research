    This week, I focused on making improvements to the photoacoustic effect model. I also did some background reading on heat conduction and thermoelastic wave propagation so that I can work towards mathematically explaining the physics behind the model in future weeks.

    Photoacoustic Effect Modeling

    Two of the main components that were added to last week’s model are the implementation of pulsed laser light rather than a steady beam of light, and boundaries that enabled the heat to flow out of the silicon diaphragm. The latter of these two involved adding another component to the model- the “backplate” of MEMs microphones.

    The pulsed light implemented in the model has a duty cycle of 1ms and a period of 5ms. The temperature curve and magnitude of vibrations corresponding to the pulsed laser is shown below:
