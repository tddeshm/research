    Last week, I talked about the photoacoustic effect as one possible physical model for the LightCommands attack. This week, I read more about the photovoltaic effect as an alternative explanation for how the attack may be working. To investigate which one of the effects is more prevalent in MEMs microphones, I began working with COMSOL Multiphysics Simulation Software to create a model based on the interaction of a laser with the diaphragm of MEMs microphone.

    Photovoltaic Effect
</h2>

<p>
    The photovoltaic effect is very similar to the photoelectric effect. In both cases, when electromagnetic light hits a material, photons transfer energy to excite electrons. However, while the photoelectric effect considers electrons emitted into free space, the photovoltaic effect is used when referring to electron excitation that stays within the material itself, often leading to the production of electric current. 
</p>

<p>
    An example of a material where this effect is particularly useful is for semiconductor p-n junctions. This material is characterized by having two energy bands for electrons to be in- the valence band where electrons have lower energy, and the conduction band, which consists of excited electrons. Excitation of electrons to the conduction band leads to a buildup of electrons in the conduction band and electron holes (positive charges) in the valence band. When the electrons and electron holes move in opposite directions through the material, current is generated.
</p>

<p>
    In MEMs microphones, if laser light is reflected from the back plate to hit the acoustic sensor, a current can be generated through the photovoltaic effect. On the other hand, if laser light is causing vibrations of the diaphragm mimicking the effect of acoustic pressure waves, then the LightCommands attack is more likely to be caused by the photoacoustic effect.

<h2 class="section-heading">Modeling with COMSOL</h2>

<h3 class="section-subheading">Background</h3>

<p>
    There are multiple basic models already available online through the COMSOL application gallery. To model the interaction of the laser and diaphragm in the MEMs microphone, I combined two models, <i>Laser Heating of a Silicon Wafer</i> and <i>Vibrating Membrane</i>. The first of these models enables time-dependent temperature fluctuations throughout silicon. The second model focuses on how applied stresses on a fixed boundary material lead to vibrations of a membrane. 
</p>

<p>
    By coupling heat transfer with solid mechanics, what we are really looking at is the photoacoustic effect rather than the photovoltaic effect since vibrations of a material can produce acoustic effects (see Week 0 blog post). If there are significant vibrations of a silicon wafer by heating through a 5mW or 60mW laser, then we may attribute the production of sounds by laser to the photoacoustic effect.
</p>

<h3 class="section-subheading">Initial Results and Steps Moving Forward</h3>

<p>
    From an initial heating of the material (with time dependence), the vibrations that appeared were on the scale of 10e-9m which is smaller than the dimensions of the MEMs diaphragm, 5e-4m X 2.5e-8m. However, before ruling out the magnitude of the photoacoustic effect in MEMs microphones, we can make a couple modifications to the model which not only give a more accurate representation of the MEMs microphone and experimental setup from the LightCommands paper, but also provide mechanisms to amplify photoacoustic effects.
</p>

<p>
    One such modification is introducing multiple pulses of the laser. The laser heating of the current set-up is constant over the entire time period. While this is useful as a baseline to determine the magnitude of vibrations, the pulsed laser is important since it can produce an oscillating movement of the diaphragm that more closely resembles the mechanism of sound hitting the diaphragm. Additionally, pulsed laser light is the method that was used in the LightCommands paper as well as other photoacoustic experiments discussed in the Week 0 blog post.
</p>

<p>
    Another modification is adding air to the model. Currently, the model assumes that the experiment is performed in a vacuum. However, from the readings introduced in Week 0, there have been multiple experiments where free air has enabled the absorption of light and consequent production of sound due to thermal wave propagation throughout gas as well as acoustic pressure on surrounding material. Thus, it is important to add parameters of air to fully analyze the photoacoustic effect.
