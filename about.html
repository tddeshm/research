<p>I am an Undergraduate student at the University of Michigan studying Physics and Computer Science.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working on researching light commands through the SPQR lab. Light commands are
    attacks on MEMs microphones where attackers can inject commands into voice-activated systems such as 
    Aexa, Siri and Google Assistant using laser-based audio injection. We are currently investigated the
    physics behind the attack by looking at consequences of the photoacoustic and photovoltaic effects.
</p>

<p>I also work with Dr. Valluri from the University of Michigan Astronomy Department to
    study kinematics around black holes in disk galaxy simulations. Currently, we are looking at the
    M-Sigma relation in Illustris TNG-100 simulation galaxies and comparing the effect of 
    different velocity dispersion measurement methods on the relationship.

<p class="mb-5">In the past, I have also researched water quality from a microbial perspective at
    the University of Glasgow (summer 2018).
