<p>I am an Undergraduate student at the University of Michigan studying Physics and Computer Science.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working on researching light commands through the SPQR lab. Light commands are
    attacks on MEMs microphones where attackers can inject commands into voice-activated systems such as 
    Aexa, Siri or Google Assistant using laser-based audio injection. We are currently investigated the
    physics behind the attack by looking at consequences of the photoacoustic and photovoltaic effects.
